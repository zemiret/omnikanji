# TODO:
DONE * fix omnikanji radicals
DONE * reverse lookup (eng -> japanese)
* better furigana HTML (there is a dedicated tag)
* bigger search field (css)
* cache'ing (simple, in-memory, sth like cache 1000 most hot results, maybe some jisho tags could be useful)
* server panic recovery (when not in debug mode?) - probably some contact page to me
* site statistics (number of visitors, etc.)
* some "buy me a cofee or sth"
* public deploy
* more dictionaries?
