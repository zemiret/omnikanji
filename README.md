# TODO:
DONE * fix omnikanji radicals
DONE * reverse lookup (eng -> japanese)
DONE * better furigana HTML (html ruby tag)
DONE * tests. It really be easier having them I think (maybe a few e2e will do for all)
* yahari (in kana) and yahari in kanji - wrong jisho parsing, both at "prod", and this version. The problem is that jisho sometimes provides us with ruby, and sometimes with spans per each kanji-furigana.
* bigger search field (css)
* cache'ing (simple, in-memory, sth like cache 1000 most hot results, maybe some jisho tags could be useful)
* server panic recovery (when not in debug mode?) - probably some contact page to me
* site statistics (number of visitors, the most searched words) (what are the options?)
* some "buy me a cofee or sth"
* public deploy (REMOVE PRIVATE DATA FROM compose)
* license
* make it more mobile friendly
* more dictionaries?
