# TODO:
DONE * fix omnikanji radicals
DONE * reverse lookup (eng -> japanese)
DONE * better furigana HTML (html ruby tag)
* tests. It really be easier having them I think (maybe a few e2e will do for all)
* bigger search field (css)
* cache'ing (simple, in-memory, sth like cache 1000 most hot results, maybe some jisho tags could be useful)
* server panic recovery (when not in debug mode?) - probably some contact page to me
* site statistics (number of visitors, the most searched words)
* some "buy me a cofee or sth"
* public deploy (REMOVE PRIVATE DATA FROM compose)
* license
* more dictionaries?

Words for testing:
何
兄弟
路面電車停留場 
あったり前
相変わらず
ペラペラ
driver's licence
